A repository is a mechanism for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects. It is a specialization of the @Component annotation allowing for implementation classes to be autodetected through classpath scanning.

@Repository is a Spring annotation that indicates that the decorated class is a repository
