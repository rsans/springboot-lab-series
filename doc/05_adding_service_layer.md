# Creating a Service layer

Service Components are the class file which contains @Service annotation. These class files are used to write business logic in a different layer, separated from @RestController class file

## Create the service interface

We are going to create the interface for the service component in the package com.hotelbeds.springbootlab.service and we will give it the name of CustomerService

```
package com.hotelbeds.springbootlab.service;

public interface CustomerService {

}
```

Add to this interface a public method that returns a String

```
package com.hotelbeds.springbootlab.service;

public interface CustomerService {

    String message();

}
```

Now that we have the created interface we are going to create our first implementation and add the necessary springboot annotations to act as a Service spring component.

For this we will create an implementation class in the same package with the name CustomerServiceImpl. This class should be decorated with the @Service annotation and implement our interface :

```
package com.hotelbeds.springbootlab.service;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;


@Service
public class CustomerServiceImpl implements CustomerService {

    @Override
    public String message() {
        return "Response from my first REST Controller in springboot";
    }

}

```

That's all. We can already use our service from the controller. So we are going to modify the greeting() method of the controller to replace the String with a call to the method implemented in our service.


First we need to inject the service into the controller. Starting with Spring 2.5, the framework introduced a new style of Dependency Injection driven by @Autowired Annotations. This annotation allows Spring to resolve and inject collaborating beans into your bean.

You can read more about dependency injection in [docs.spring.io](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-spring-beans-and-dependency-injection.html)

In the newest Spring release, it’s constructor does not need to be annotated with @Autowired annotation. With Lombok, it’s possible to generate a constructor for either all class’s fields (with @AllArgsConstructor) or all final class’s fields (with @RequiredArgsConstructor).

```
package com.hotelbeds.springbootlab.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;

import com.hotelbeds.springbootlab.service.CustomerService;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/customer")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class CustomerController {

    private final CustomerService customerService;

    @GetMapping
    public String greeting() {
        return customerService.message();
    }

}

```
